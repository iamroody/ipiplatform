    %p{:align => 'center', :style => 'color: #6bb8d4; font-size: 1.5em;'}What kind of innovator are you?
    %p{:align => 'center', :style => 'padding: 10px'} Start your process by finding out exactly how you work and innovate in a creative environment. Take the Ipsative survey; a simple, unique, and accurate  way to map out your creative thought process across 5 spectrums of analysis. This result becomes the keystone of your innovative journey on Sidekick as your innovator type is then used to get you to tools and other content  meant to play off your own personal skills and attributes.
