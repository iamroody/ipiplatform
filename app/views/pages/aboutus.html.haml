			IPI is a dynamic group of designers, business professionals and an engineer, brought together by ThoughtWorks to tackle the challenge of democratizing access to innovation. Over the course of a 12-week summer internship, the team has deconstructed the innovation process, through research, exploration, workshops, and small-scale activities, with an eye toward taking the mystery out of it for those who may not have much innovation experience.

			Sidekick is the culmination of the IPI team’s deep dive. An online platform that provides the tools to help innovators throughout their process, Sidekick provides tailored resources and personalized insights to make innovation simpler.
