== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 1.9.3

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.

* General go to website for setting up the overall system:
   http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book

* Web resource Mike Varona found that was useful when installing systems
   http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/
  Additional words of wisdom about resource:

   BTW, for Homebrew, when you run 'brew doctor', you might not get "ready to brew".

   I consistently get this message after running 'brew doctor':

   Warning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed:
     /Users/Thoughtworks/.rvm/bin/port, /opt/local/bin/port

   This can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to temporarily move them out of the way, e.g.

     sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports

   But in the end, I didn't want/know how to remove/move macports and everything worked fine.


   If you get this type of message:

   Warning: Some keg-only formula are linked into the Cellar.
   Linking a keg-only formula, such as gettext, into the cellar with `brew link <formula>` will cause other formulae to detect them during the `./configure` step. This may cause problems when compiling those
other formulae.

   Binaries provided by keg-only formulae may override system binaries with other strange results.

   You may wish to `brew unlink` these brews:

   libxml2

   then just do what Homebrew suggests in that last line...
