Touchpoints Matrix,Roberta Tassi,http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/108,"Conceived by Gianluca Brugnoli -teacher at Politecnico di Milano and designer at Frog Design- the touchpoints matrix merges some features of the customer journey maps with some features of the system maps and is based on the use of personas.
The basic idea is to provide a visual framework that enables designer to “connect the dots of the user experience” in order to see the different configurations, interfaces, contexts and results of the interaction with a specific product-service system.
The matrix is built by listing vertically the different devices or contexts that are part of the system and by listing horizontally the main actions that are supported by the system itself.
Once this structure has been composed, the designer can put a specific persona inside and imagine his journey through the different touchpoints, connecting the related dots.
In this way the matrix brings to a deeper comprehension of the interaction and facilitates a further development of the opportunities given by the system -of the possible entry points and paths- shifting the focus of the design activities to connections:
“Design for connections: in the system scenario, design is mainly focused on finding the
connections with the whole network, than in creating closed and self-sufficient systems, tools and services.

The team then focus on the ‘future state' which often represents a significant change in the way the system currently operates. This means that the team need to develop an implementation strategy to make the future state a reality.

Now and New Now,Nesta,http://www.businessdesigntools.com/2011/12/now-and-new-now/attachment/05/,"Now and New Now is a simplified version of the Blueprint Modelling  exercise and guide to develop a Business Plan. The main difference between this 2 approaches is that Now and New Now use the entrepreneur skills as a starting point. The entrepreneur still doesn't know what his business is going to be, but tries to envision his future and the steps he need to take to achieve it. It is more a learning exercise than a planning tool (as the Blueprint modelling is).

This exercise allows entrepreneurs to think about what they are good at, what skills they think are necessary to be successful in the future and which steps they need to take to achieve their goals.

The exercise can be done individually or in group. Working in group though is quite successful as other people may think of ways to achieve goals that the entrepreneur alone couldn't have thought about as other people will have different experiences and perspectives on the actions to take.","Now and New Now is a simplified version of the Blueprint Modelling  exercise and guide to develop a Business Plan.
